Intro
-----

Ease production of VBA code with the VBEX library of rich idiomatic containers and some functional programing capabilities to bring VBA into the new millenium. With VBEX you can:

  1. Use Class Constructors for immutable classes.
  1. Print meaningful debug methods that reveal a datastructures contents
        ```vba
        Console.PrintLine List.Create(1, 2, 3, 4) ' Note usage of class constructors
        List(1, 2, 3, 4)
        ```

  1. Create functional objects to use with higher order functions.  With those we have created some monadic classes _(List, Maybe, Try)_ that implement the traditonal `Map`, `FlatMap` or `Bind` methods.
  1. Access a growing library of Containers.
  1. Perform file-system operations.
      - These will later be replaced or enhanced with an object-oriented model
  1. Later there will be APIs for <strike>ADODB (SQL)</strike> and Windows Scripting Host
    2. ADODB/SQL implemented with `SqlConnection`, `SqlCommand`, and `SqlResult`!


Install
-------

Once you acquire the source by either cloning this repo or downloading zip and extracting

  1. Run the _Make.ps1_ script to build _VBEXsrc.xlam_ and _VBEXtest.xlam_.
      - _VBEXtest.xlam_ contains unit-testing code and is only relevant to development.
  1. Reference _VBEXsrc.xlam_ in projects to use VBEX
      - From the VBE from the menu _tools >> References >> Browse_.
  1. Enable ["Programmatic access to Office VBA project"](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/282830)
      -  This is required for the Lambda class as it auto-generates code in a blank module.

Usage
-----

VBEX is not a normal VBA library, before you start using you should understand the following aspects about VBEX.

### Predeclared Objects

All public classes have a predeclared instance of that class called the "predeclared object".
  - The predeclared object has the same name as the class, _e.g._

```vba
Dim xs As List ' word "List" as a type
Set xs = List.Create(1, 2, 3) ' word "List" here is the predeclared object
```

  - All creatable classes are created from the predeclared object.
  - Predeclared objects of mutable classes can be mutated, but there is no reason for one to ever do so.

### Inheritance

Since VBA has only Interface Inheritance,
code that would be put in parent or abstract classesis instead put into `def*` modules.
While this reduces code duplication, it only reduces it to trivial code like,
    
```vba
Public Function IsSubSetOf(ByVal other As SetLike) As Boolean

    IsSubSetOf = defSetLike.IsSubSetOf(Me, other)

End Function

Private Function SetLike_IsSubSetOf(ByVal other As SetLike) As Boolean

    SetLike_IsSubSetOf = IsSubSetOf(other)

End Function
```

This screams for some macro or preprocessing system, but that doesn't exist yet.

### Applicable

Implementations of the _Applicable_ interface allow methods and functions to be treated as objects.
  - All Applicable objects are immutable.
  - The _Lambda_ class writes functions to a VBEX modules and allows you to execute that code.
      + Using the Lambda class will sometimes disable the debugger.
      + A lambda has no reference to environment in it was created.
          * `Lambda.FromShort("_ + x")` will always error even if `x` is in the current scope.
  - _OnArgs_ and _OnObject_ are complementary.
      + `OnArgs.Make(myObject, "method", vbMethod)` is `(x) => myObject.method(x)`
      + `OnObject.Make("method", vbMethod, myArgs)` is `(o) => o.method(myArgs)`
      + These are the _only_ applicable objects that have references to the current environment.
